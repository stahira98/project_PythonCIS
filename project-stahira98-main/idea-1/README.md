The objective is to explore the medicare data for inpatient and outpatient care. 

According to https://www.sgu.edu/blog/medical/inpatient-versus-outpatient. Inpatient, in the most basic sense, refers to someone admitted to the hospital to stay overnight, whether briefly or for an extended period of time. Physicians keep these patients at the hospital to monitor them more closely. Outpatient care, also called ambulatory care, defines any service or treatment that doesn’t require hospitalization. An annual exam with your primary care physician is an example of outpatient care, but so are emergent cases where the patient leaves the emergency department the same day they arrive. Any appointment at a clinic or specialty facility outside the hospital is considered outpatient care as well. While there’s a clear difference between an inpatient and an outpatient, there is a little bit of gray area as well. Occasionally, physicians will assign a patient observation status while they determine whether hospitalization is required. This period typically lasts for no more than 24 hours. Also note that the location itself doesn’t define whether you’re an inpatient versus outpatient. It’s the duration of stay, not the type of establishment, that determines your status.

You are encouraged to refine the exploration objective and related tasks by yourself. A few examples include:
1. Are there any differences regarding the cost of inpatient/outpatient procedures among providers for the same state or across different states? Visualize the result.
2. For the same procedure, is there any cost difference between inpatient and outpatient care? Visualize the result.
3. Visualize and compare the inpatient/outpatient ratio among different states.
4. Visualize and compare the cost of the same procedure among different states.
5. List the top 10 outpatient procedures, are they the same for each state?
6. List and compare the top 10 expensive outpatient and inpatient care, are they the same for each state?
7. Which provider has the lowest inpatient or outpatient care cost overall in the country or in each state?
